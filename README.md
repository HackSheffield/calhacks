# Teams

## A GitHub Organisation Visualiser

GitHub Organisations are a very private affair, but they're a great way of representing different teams within a group. Teams allows you to present your GitHub organisation to the world, even allowing you to add any extra features not already present in a standard GitHub profile.

## Installation

Set your GraphQL access token to an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and let `npm` do the rest.

```
npm install
npm start
```
